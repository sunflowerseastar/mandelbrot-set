* Mandelbrot Set

This is a visualization of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set][Mandelbrot set]]. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set][escape time algorithm]] is written in Rust, which is packaged as wasm using [[https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack][wasm-pack]].

#+begin_src sh
wasm-pack build

cd www
npm install
npm start # localhost:8080
#+end_src

Note that using `yarn` instead of `npm install` makes it such that running ~wasm-pack build~ will not trigger a webpack-dev-server rebuild (and browser refresh).
